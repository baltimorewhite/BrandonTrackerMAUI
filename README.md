# BrandonTrackerMAUI

A mobile app built with .NET MAUI and C# to help drivers at Brandon Shredding track their daily tasks, view completed jobs, and personalize their experience. This project is adapted from a real-world logistics tool and fulfills the requirements of the ICT40120 Mobile Development assessment.

- View daily tasks assigned from the Run Sheet
- Mark tasks as completed
- Review completed tasks in a separate view
- Edit task details if mistakes are made
- Customize preferences like theme and font size

- **C#** for backend logic and data models
- **XAML** for UI layout and styling
